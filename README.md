# Lūʻau

Welcome to the Lua Lūʻau! 

## What's in a name?

In ancient Hawaii, there were strict rules about who could eat together and what they could eat.
However, in 1819, King Kamehameha II abolished the religious laws and broke the taboos by eating with women marking the end of the kapu (taboo) system.
From this symbolic act were born the lūʻau parties.

Taking inspiration from King Kamehameha II's symbolic act of ending the kapu system we'll explore the power of Lua to break down taboos and unleash new possibilities.
